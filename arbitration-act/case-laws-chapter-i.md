# Chapter I : Case Laws

Chapter I of the **Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996** (Sections 2–6) covers General Provisions. As of 2026, the case law in this area focuses heavily on the definition of "Court" and the "International" nature of disputes, as well as the mandate of **minimal judicial interference**.

## 1. Section 2: Definitions (Seat, Court, and International)

* **Jagdeep Chowgule v. Sheela Chowgule (2026):**
* **The Rule:** A landmark 2026 ruling that clarified the definition of **"Court"** under Section 2(1)(e).
* **The Decision:** The Supreme Court held that the "Court" for the purpose of extending timelines (Section 29A) is the **Principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction**, regardless of whether the High Court initially appointed the arbitrator under Section 11. This settled a long-standing "jurisdictional anomaly" between High Courts and District Courts.


* **BALCO v. Kaiser Aluminium Technical Services (2012 / Reaffirmed 2025):**
* **The Rule:** The "Seat" of arbitration determines the "Court" that has supervisory jurisdiction.
* **Application:** If the seat is outside India, Part I (Sections 2–43) generally does not apply. Recent 2025 rulings (like *Balaji Steel Trade*) have strictly applied this, holding that the "mother agreement" determines the seat, which cannot be easily overridden by subsequent communications.


* **Mankastu Impex v. Airvisual Ltd. (2020 / 2024 Trends):**
* **The Rule:** Distinguished between **"Seat" and "Venue."**
* **The Decision:** Merely calling a place a "venue" for meetings does not make it the juridical "seat" under Section 2(1)(e) unless the contract clearly shows an intention to make that place the legal home of the arbitration.


* **TDM Infrastructure v. UE Development India (2008 / Applied 2025):**
* **The Rule:** Definition of **International Commercial Arbitration** (Section 2(1)(f)).
* **The Decision:** If both companies are incorporated in India, the arbitration is **domestic**, even if the "central management and control" of one company is exercised outside India. This prevents two Indian companies from bypassing Indian law by calling their dispute "international."

## 2. Section 5: Minimal Judicial Interference

Section 5 is the "guardrail" of the Act, stating that no judicial authority shall intervene except where provided in Part I.

* **In Re: Interplay between Arbitration Agreements and Stamp Act (2024):**
* **The Rule:** The 7-judge bench used **Section 5** to protect the arbitral process from being stalled by technicalities.
* **The Decision:** Courts should not decide on the "stamping" of a contract at the referral stage (Section 8 or 11). To do so would violate the mandate of minimal interference. The Arbitrator should decide such issues under the principle of *Kompetenz-Kompetenz*.


* **Hindustan Construction Co. v. Bihar Rajya Pul Nirman Nigam (2025):**
* **The Rule:** Finality of Section 11 orders.
* **The Decision:** A High Court cannot "review" or nullify its own order of appointing an arbitrator once the process has moved forward. Doing so would undermine **Section 5** and the autonomy of the arbitral tribunal.


* **Gayatri Balasamy v. ISG Novasoft Technologies (2025):**
* **The Rule:** While Section 5 limits intervention, it does not mean courts are "powerless."
* **The Decision:** The SC clarified that the "negative facet" of Section 5 prohibits interference where the Tribunal has jurisdiction, but the "positive facet" allows the court to act in ways explicitly sanctioned by the Act (like modifying an award's interest rate to ensure it's not illegal).

## 3. Section 2(4): Statutory Arbitrations

* **NHAI v. Paras Ram & Others (Dec 2025):**
* **The Rule:** Part I applies to "every arbitration under any other enactment."
* **The Decision:** Confirmed that for land acquisition disputes under the National Highways Act, the 1996 Act (Part I) applies as if there were a consensual arbitration agreement. This ensures that statutory arbitrations are also subject to the Section 34 challenge and Section 36 enforcement.

### Summary of Key Principles (2026 Update)

1. **Jurisdictional Clarity:** The "Court" under Section 2(1)(e) is usually the District/Commercial Court for domestic matters, even if a higher court appointed the arbitrator.
2. **Strict Neutrality:** Section 5 is now applied more strictly than ever—if a section doesn't explicitly say a court can intervene, it **cannot**.
3. **Party Autonomy:** Definitions under Section 2 are interpreted to favor the parties' choice of seat over the location of the cause of action.
