Chapter VII (Sections 34) is the most critical part of the Act for practitioners, as it deals with **Recourse Against the Arbitral Award**.

In 2025 and 2026, the Indian judiciary made a historic shift. For nearly 30 years, the rule was "Set Aside or Uphold." As of 2026, we have entered the era of **"Limited Modification."**

## 1. The 2025 Revolution: Power to Modify Awards

Until recently, the Supreme Court held in *NHAI v. M. Hakeem (2021)* that courts could not touch the "merits" of an award—they could only scrap it or keep it. This changed in 2025.

* **Gayatri Balasamy v. ISG Novasoft Technologies (April 30, 2025):**
* **The Landmark Ruling:** A 5-judge Constitution Bench ruled (4:1) that Indian courts **do possess a limited power to modify** an arbitral award under Section 34.
* **The "Greater Power" Principle:** The court applied the legal maxim *omne majus continet in se minus*—the greater power to "set aside" includes the lesser power to "modify."
* **Strict Conditions for Modification:** A court can only modify an award in four specific scenarios:
1. **Severability:** Striking down an invalid part of the award while keeping the valid portion (if they can be separated without destroying the logic of the award).
2. **Clerical/Computational Errors:** Correcting obvious typos or math errors apparent on the face of the record.
3. **Interest Rates:** Adjusting the rate of post-award interest to ensure it is fair and not usurious.
4. **Manifest Errors:** Correcting "manifest errors" that do not require a fresh look at the evidence or a re-evaluation of the merits.

## 2. Section 34(2A): Patent Illegality

This ground is only available for **domestic** arbitrations (not International Commercial Arbitrations).

* **Jan De Nul Dredging India v. Tuticorin Port Trust (Jan 9, 2026):**
* **The Rule:** Reconfirmed that "Patent Illegality" must be an error of law that goes to the **root of the matter**.
* **The Warning:** A court cannot set aside an award just because the Arbitrator took one of two possible views. If the view is "plausible," the court must step back.


* **Arif and Sons India Ltd. v. Intense Impex (Nov 2025):**
* **The Rule:** An award granted for "business loss" with **zero evidence** or zero reasoning is patently illegal. The court held that while the quantity of evidence is the Arbitrator's domain, a "total absence of evidence" is a jurisdictional flaw.

## 3. Public Policy and "Shameful Delay"

* **K. Satyanarayana Raju v. Union of India (Jan 7, 2026):**
* **The Rule:** Undue delay can kill an award.
* **The Decision:** The Madras High Court ruled that while "mere delay" isn't enough to set aside an award, a **massive, unexplained delay** (in this case, several years) that results in a perversion of the findings makes the award "in conflict with the public policy of India."

| Ground | Key Case Law (2025-26) | Court's Power |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Modification** | *Gayatri Balasamy (2025)* | **Can Modify** if severable or manifest error. |
| **Patent Illegality** | *Jan De Nul Dredging (2026)* | **Must Set Aside** if error goes to the root. |
| **Public Policy** | *Satyanarayana Raju (2026)* | **Must Set Aside** if delay or fraud shocks conscience. |
| **Interpretation** | *Somdatt Builders v. NHAI (2025)* | **Cannot Intervene** if the Arbitrator's view is plausible. |

### **Important Procedural Note:**

If you are moving for a stay of the award under **Section 36** while your Section 34 petition is pending, remember the **2021 Amendment** (which we discussed earlier regarding Fraud). The court will now look at whether the award was "induced by fraud" as a primary condition for an unconditional stay.
