Arbitration law in India has transitioned from being highly interventionist to a "pro-arbitration" regime. As of 2026, the legal landscape is defined by the principle of **minimal judicial interference** and the **separability** of arbitration clauses.

Below is a categorized list of landmark and recent case laws relevant to the **Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996**.

## 1. Landmark "Foundational" Judgments

These cases established the core principles that govern arbitration in India today.

* **BALCO v. Kaiser Aluminium Technical Services (2012):** The "watershed" moment that established the "seat" vs "venue" distinction. It ruled that Part I of the Act (power of Indian courts to intervene) does not apply to foreign-seated arbitrations.
* **Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corp. (2021):** Defined "arbitrability." It established a four-fold test to determine if a dispute can be arbitrated (e.g., criminal cases and matrimonial disputes are generally non-arbitrable).
* **TRF Ltd. v. Energo Engineering (2017) & Perkins Eastman v. HSCC (2019):** Strictly prohibited **unilateral appointment** of arbitrators. If a person is legally ineligible to be an arbitrator, they cannot nominate another person to act as one.
* **Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings v. Future Retail Ltd. (2021):** Legitimized **Emergency Arbitrator** awards in India-seated arbitrations, providing teeth to interim reliefs.

## 2. Recent High-Impact Rulings (2024–2026)

The following recent judgments have clarified procedural ambiguities and reduced court bottlenecks.

### Stamping and Admissibility

* **In Re: Interplay between Arbitration Agreements and the Stamp Act (2023/24):** A 7-judge bench unanimously ruled that **unstamped or insufficiently stamped agreements are NOT void**. They are merely inadmissible as evidence—a curable defect. This prevents parties from using technical stamping issues to stall the appointment of an arbitrator.

### Power to Modify Awards

* **Gayatri Balasamy v. ISG Novasoft Technologies (2025):** A 5-judge Constitution Bench held that courts have a **limited power to modify** arbitral awards under Sections 34 and 37. This is a departure from the earlier "all or nothing" approach (where a court could only set aside or uphold an award), provided the offending part is severable.

### Timelines and Jurisdiction

* **Jagdeep Chowgule v. Sheela Chowgule (2026):** Clarified that only **Civil Courts of original jurisdiction** (as defined in Section 2(1)(e)) have the power to extend arbitration timelines under **Section 29A**. The High Court or Supreme Court does not retain "residual" power just because they appointed the arbitrator under Section 11.
* **Hindustan Construction Co. v. Bihar Rajya Pul Nirman Nigam (2025):** Reaffirmed that a High Court cannot review or nullify its own order of appointing an arbitrator once the process has significantly progressed, emphasizing the finality of Section 11 appointments.
