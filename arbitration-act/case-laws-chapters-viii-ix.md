In the Indian arbitration landscape, **Chapter VIII (Finality and Enforcement)** and **Chapter IX (Appeals)** are the "business end" of the Act. They ensure that once an award is passed, it translates into a tangible result, while providing a narrow safety valve for appeals.

As of 2026, the following case laws are the most relevant for these chapters:

---

## 1. Chapter VIII: Enforcement (Sections 35 & 36)

The primary goal of Section 36 is to treat an arbitral award as a **Decree of a Civil Court**.

* **Hindustan Construction Company (HCC) v. Union of India (2019/2025):** * **The Rule:** This is the definitive case on **Automatic Stays**. It struck down Section 87 (which had temporarily revived automatic stays).
* **Current Standing:** Filing a challenge under Section 34 does **not** stay the execution of an award. The award-debtor must file a separate application for a stay and usually deposit a significant portion of the award amount in court.


* **Pam Developments Pvt. Ltd. v. State of West Bengal (2019):**
* **The Rule:** Even if the Government is the party challenging an award, they are **not entitled to an unconditional stay**. They must provide security/deposit money just like a private party.


* **BCCI v. Kochi Cricket Pvt. Ltd. (2018):** * Clarified that the 2015 Amendment (removing automatic stays) applies even to arbitration proceedings that started before the amendment, provided the Section 34 challenge was filed after the amendment.
* **Sundaram Finance v. NEPC India Ltd. (2025 Clarification):**
* Confirmed that once an award is final, enforcement proceedings are governed by the **Code of Civil Procedure (CPC)** and are independent of the initial arbitration location (Section 42 does not apply to execution).

## 2. Chapter IX: Appeals (Section 37)

Section 37 is "restrictive"—you can only appeal the specific orders listed in the section, and **no others**.

* **Gayatri Balasamy v. ISG Novasoft Technologies (2025):**
* **The Rule:** A 5-judge bench ruled that while Section 37 limits the court's power, the court can **modify** an award instead of just setting it aside if the illegal part is "severable." This is a massive shift from the earlier "all-or-nothing" approach.


* **Chintels India Ltd. v. Bhayana Builders (2021/2024):**
* **The Rule:** If a court **refuses to condone the delay** in filing a Section 34 application, that refusal is an appealable order under Section 37. Essentially, a dismissal on the grounds of limitation is treated as "refusing to set aside an award."


* **Somdatt Builders NCC–NEC (JV) v. NHAI (2025):**
* **The Rule:** Reaffirmed that a Section 37 court **cannot re-appreciate evidence** or reinterpret a contract if the Arbitrator’s view was "plausible." It warns against the High Courts acting as a "second court of appeal" on facts.


* **Jan De Nul Dredging India v. Tuticorin Port Trust (2026):**
* **The Rule:** The Supreme Court held that the scope of Section 37 is strictly limited to the grounds available under Section 34. If an award cannot be disturbed under Section 34, a Section 37 court has zero jurisdiction to interfere.

### Pro-Tip for 2026

The **2021 Amendment** added a crucial proviso to Section 36: If the court is prima facie satisfied that the **arbitration agreement or the award was induced by fraud or corruption**, it must grant an **unconditional stay** on the award pending the Section 34 challenge.

## Test for Fraud
The 2021 Amendment to **Section 36(3)** introduced a mandatory "unconditional stay" if the court is satisfied that a *prima facie* case of fraud or corruption exists.

However, as of 2026, the Supreme Court has set an **extremely high bar** for what qualifies as "fraud" to prevent this provision from becoming a loophole for every losing party to delay payment.

## 1. The "Exceptional Case" Test (2025–2026)

Recent rulings, particularly **Popular Caterers v. Ameet Mehta (2025)** and **Lifestyle Equities C.V. v. Amazon Technologies (2025)**, have established a rigorous four-pronged test for granting an unconditional stay. To succeed, the applicant must show the award or agreement is:

1. **Egregiously Perverse:** The error must be so shocking that no reasonable person could have reached that conclusion.
2. **Facially Untenable:** The illegality must be visible "on the face of the record" without needing a deep dive into evidence.
3. **Riddled with Patent Illegalities:** Not just a wrong interpretation of law, but a violation of the fundamental policy of Indian law.
4. **Induced by Fraud/Corruption:** Specifically, that the award was obtained by **suppressing material evidence** or making **false statements** to take an unfair advantage.

---

## 2. Defining "Fraud" and "Corruption"

Courts have now clearly distinguished between "legal errors" and "fraud" under the Act:

* **Fraud Simpliciter vs. Serious Fraud:** Based on the **Avitel Post Studioz (2020/21)** and **Rashid Raza** tests, an unconditional stay is only granted if the fraud "percolates the entire contract" and renders the arbitration agreement itself void.
* **The Deception Requirement:** In **Union of India v. Rahul Kumar Thakur (2025)**, the Calcutta High Court (upheld in spirit by the SC) clarified that "making of the award" induced by fraud means a party **wilfully withheld** documents to deceive the arbitrator.
* **Corruption is not "Wrong Judgement":** Corruption requires proof of **moral turpitude** or "moral obliquity" on the part of the arbitrator. An honest mistake or a "bad" appreciation of evidence is **not** corruption.

## 3. Key Cases on the 2021 Proviso

| Case Law | Judicial Standard Established |
| --- | --- |
| **Popular Caterers v. Ameet Mehta (Nov 2025)** | The SC set aside an unconditional stay, ruling that the "Exceptional Case" standard was not met. Allegations of fraud must be **pleaded and prima facie established**; they cannot be assumed. |
| **Lifestyle Equities v. Amazon (2025)** | Held that unconditional stays are **rare exceptions**. In 99% of cases, a deposit (usually 50% to 100% of the award) is a prerequisite for a stay. |
| **Sepco Electric v. Power Mech Projects (2022/24)** | Confirmed that even if a court finds a *prima facie* case, it still has the discretion to look at the "balance of convenience" before granting a stay. |
| **Damodar Valley Corp v. Reliance Infra (2024)** | Stated that the fraud must "shock the conscience of the court" to bypass the requirement of a security deposit. |

## 4. Practical Takeaway for 2026

* **No Suo Motu Stays:** Courts generally will not grant an unconditional stay unless the party specifically files an application under the **Section 36(3) proviso** and provides specific evidence of the fraud.
* **Retrospective Application:** The "fraud proviso" applies **retrospectively** to all pending cases (from 2015 onwards), as confirmed in the *BCCI v. Kochi Cricket* line of cases.
* **The "Money Decree" Parallel:** Under **Order XLI Rule 5 of the CPC**, a stay on a money decree is never automatic. The 2021 amendment aligns arbitration with this principle, making "fraud" the only way to avoid a deposit.
