**IN THE COURT OF THE DISTRICT JUDGE / COMMERCIAL COURT AT [CITY]**
**O.M.P. (I) (COMM) NO. ____ OF 2026**

**IN THE MATTER OF:**
[Award Debtor Name] ... **Petitioner/Applicant**
**VERSUS**
[Award Holder Name] ... **Respondent**

### **APPLICATION UNDER SECTION 36(3) OF THE ARBITRATION AND CONCILIATION ACT, 1996 (AS AMENDED IN 2021) SEEKING UNCONDITIONAL STAY OF THE OPERATION OF THE ARBITRAL AWARD DATED [DATE]**

**THE APPLICANT ABOVE-NAMED MOST RESPECTFULLY SHOWETH:**

1. That the Applicant has filed the accompanying Petition under Section 34 of the Act challenging the Arbitral Award dated [Date] passed by the Ld. Sole Arbitrator/Tribunal in the matter of [Case Name/Reference].
2. That the present application is being moved seeking an **unconditional stay** on the enforcement of the said Award, as the Applicant has a *prima facie* case that the [Arbitration Agreement / Making of the Award] was induced and effected by **fraud and corruption**.

**GROUNDS FOR UNCONDITIONAL STAY**

3. **Inducement by Fraud (Section 36(3) Proviso II):** The Applicant submits that the Award was obtained by the Respondent through active concealment and suppression of material evidence.

* *Particulars of Fraud:* [E.g., The Respondent placed a forged "Completion Certificate" dated XX/XX/XXXX before the Tribunal, which was the sole basis for the award of damages.]
* *Impact:* Had this fraud not been committed, the Tribunal would have lacked the jurisdiction or factual basis to pass the Impugned Award.

4. **Corruption in the Making of the Award:** The Applicant prima facie establishes that the proceedings were tainted by moral obliquity.

* *Evidence:* [E.g., Proof of undisclosed conflict of interest or financial collusion between the Respondent and the Tribunal, discovered post-award].

5. **Meeting the "Exceptional Circumstances" Test (Popular Caterers v. Ameet Mehta, 2025):**
The Applicant further submits that the Award is:

* **Facially Untenable:** The illegality is evident from the face of the record without requiring a deep dive into evidence.
* **Egregiously Perverse:** No reasonable person could have arrived at such a conclusion given the documents [List Documents] suppressed by the Respondent.

6. **Irreparable Loss:** If an unconditional stay is not granted, the Applicant will be forced to deposit [Amount], which was obtained through the aforementioned fraudulent means, causing a gross miscarriage of justice and financial ruin.

**PRAYER**

In light of the above, it is most respectfully prayed that this Hon’ble Court may be pleased to:

* (a) Grant an **unconditional stay** on the operation and execution of the Arbitral Award dated [Date] pending the final disposal of the Section 34 Petition;
* (b) Pass any other order as this Hon’ble Court may deem fit.

**DATE:** [Current Date, 2026]
**PLACE:** [City]

**[NAME OF ADVOCATE]**
Counsel for the Petitioner

### **Key Drafting Tips for 2026:**

* **Don't be Vague:** The 2025 rulings (like *Popular Caterers*) punish vague "fraud" claims with heavy costs. You must specify the exact document or act that was fraudulent.
* **The "Prima Facie" Standard:** You don't need to *prove* fraud beyond a doubt yet, but you must show enough evidence to "shock the conscience" of the judge.
* **Affidavit of Support:** Always accompany this with an affidavit specifically swearing to the facts of the fraud, not just a general verification.

## Procedure for Filing

Filing a stay application in a Commercial Court is a precise procedural task. Since the **Commercial Courts Act, 2015** and the **2021 Arbitration Amendment** overlap here, you must follow a "double-track" procedure: meeting the rigorous standards of arbitration law while adhering to the speed-focused timelines of the Commercial Court.

Here is the step-by-step procedure for filing a **Section 36(3)** stay application in 2026.

---

### **Step 1: Determine the Correct Forum**

Under **Section 10 of the Commercial Courts Act**, the forum depends on the nature of the arbitration:

* **International Commercial Arbitration:** File directly in the **High Court** (Commercial Division).
* **Domestic Arbitration:** File in the **Commercial Court** at the District Judge level (if the "Specified Value" is above ₹3 Lakhs, though this threshold varies by state).

### **Step 2: Concurrent Filing (The 2-Application Rule)**

In 2026, you cannot file a stay application in isolation. It must be linked to a challenge:

1. **Primary Petition:** File the **Section 34 Petition** to set aside the award.
2. **Interlocutory Application (IA):** File the **Section 36(2) Application** for stay as a separate IA within the Section 34 proceedings.
* *Note:* Filing Section 34 **does not** stay the award. If you don't file the IA, the award-holder can begin seizing assets immediately.



### **Step 3: Drafting and Essential Enclosures**

Your filing must include:

* **The Main Application:** (As drafted in the previous step).
* **Affidavit in Support:** A sworn statement by the authorized representative.
* **Certified Copy of the Award:** Essential for the court to see the "Face of the Award."
* **Statement of Assets:** Often required by Commercial Courts in 2026 to determine the "security" amount.
* **The "Fraud Affidavit" (If seeking Unconditional Stay):** If you are invoking the 2021 Amendment, you must file a specific affidavit detailing the *prima facie* evidence of fraud or corruption.

### **Step 4: Pre-Institution Mediation (Wait or Skip?)**

While the Commercial Courts Act usually mandates mediation before a suit, **Section 34 and 36 applications are exempt** from Pre-Institution Mediation. You can go straight to court.

### **Step 5: The First Hearing & "Notice"**

* **The "Regard to CPC" Rule:** The judge will follow **Order XLI Rule 5 of the CPC**.
* **The Condition:** Unless you prove fraud, the judge will typically grant a stay only on the condition that you **deposit 50% to 100%** of the award amount (or provide a Bank Guarantee) in court.
* **Caveat:** Check if the Award Holder has filed a **Caveat** under Section 148A CPC. If they have, you cannot get an *ex-parte* (one-sided) stay; their lawyer must be heard first.
