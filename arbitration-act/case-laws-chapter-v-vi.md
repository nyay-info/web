Chapters V and VI (Sections 18–33) are the "Engine Room" of the Act, governing the day-to-day conduct of proceedings and the finality of awards. The legal updates in 2025 and 2026 have shifted heavily toward enforcing **strict timelines** and **procedural discipline**.

## 1. Chapter V: Conduct of Arbitral Proceedings (Sections 18–27)

### **Section 21: Commencement of Proceedings**

* **Bhagheeratha Engineering Ltd. v. State of Kerala (Jan 2026):** * **The Rule:** A Section 21 notice is primarily for the purpose of **limitation**.
* **The Decision:** The Supreme Court held that the failure to issue a formal Section 21 notice is **not fatal** to the arbitration if the disputes are otherwise arbitrable and the party’s conduct (participation in the tribunal's formation) shows they waived the requirement.



### **Section 18 & 19: Equal Treatment and Rules of Procedure**

* **Serosoft Solutions v. Dexter Capital Advisors (Jan 2025):** * **The Rule:** High Courts should stay away from procedural orders of the Arbitrator.
* **The Decision:** Interference under Article 227 of the Constitution is only allowed if an order is **"completely perverse"** on the face of the record. Courts must discourage litigation that stalls the process just because a party dislikes a procedural decision (like allowing a witness cross-examination).

## 2. Chapter VI: Making of Arbitral Award & Termination (Sections 28–33)

This is the most litigated chapter due to **Section 29A**, which mandates that a domestic award must be passed within 12 months (extendable by 6 months).

### **Section 29A: The "Time-Limit" Doctrine**

* **Jagdeep Chowgule v. Sheela Chowgule (Jan 2026):**
* **The Landmark Rule:** **"Court"** for extension of time means the **District/Commercial Court** (Section 2(1)(e)), even if the High Court appointed the arbitrator.
* **Why it matters:** It settles the debate on judicial hierarchy. The referral court (High Court) becomes *functus officio* (its job is done) once it appoints the arbitrator. For extensions, you must go to the local Commercial Court.
* **International Exception:** In **TATA Sons v. Siva Industries**, confirmed that Section 29A's 12-month limit is **not mandatory** for International Commercial Arbitrations (it is merely a "guideline").


* **Mohan Lal Fatehpuria v. Bharat Textiles (Dec 2025):**
* **The Rule:** If the mandate expires, the arbitrator **must** be substituted unless there is a very strong reason.
* **The Decision:** The SC held that once the mandate terminates by operation of law (Section 29A(4)), the arbitrator becomes *functus officio*. Under Section 29A(6), the court has a "power and duty" to substitute the arbitrator if they were the cause of the delay.


* **Rohan Builders v. Berger Paints (2024/25):**
* **The Rule:** You can file for an extension **after** the mandate has already expired.
* **The Decision:** The phrase "prior to or after the expiry" in Section 29A(4) allows a court to revive a "dead" mandate, provided "sufficient cause" for the delay is shown.

## 3. Summary Table for 2026

| Section | Topic | Key 2025/26 Case Law |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **21** | Notice of Arbitration | *Bhagheeratha Engineering (2026)* |
| **29A** | Extension of Mandate | *Jagdeep Chowgule (2026)* |
| **29A(6)** | Substitution of Arbitrator | *Mohan Lal Fatehpuria (2025)* |
| **34** | Delay in Award | *K. Satyanarayana Raju v. UOI (2026)* |

> **Crucial Note on Delay:** In **K. Satyanarayana Raju (2026)**, the Madras High Court ruled that while mere delay is not a ground to set aside an award, a **10-year delay** that adversely affects the findings makes the award **patently illegal** and against public policy.
