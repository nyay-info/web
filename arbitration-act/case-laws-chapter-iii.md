# Chapter III : Case Laws


Chapter III (Sections 10–15) focuses on the **Composition of the Arbitral Tribunal**. In late 2024 and throughout 2025, the Supreme Court completely overhauled the law regarding how arbitrators are appointed, particularly in contracts involving the Government or PSUs.

---

## 1. Section 11: Appointment of Arbitrators

The biggest shift in 2025–2026 is the death of "Unilateral Appointments."

* **Central Organization for Railway Electrification (CORE) v. ECI-SPIC-SMO-MCML (Nov 2024 / Reaffirmed 2025):**
* **The Rule:** A 5-judge Constitution Bench finally settled the "Panel" controversy.
* **The Decision:** It ruled that an arbitration clause cannot mandate that one party must select its arbitrator from a **narrow, curated panel** prepared by the other party (usually a PSU).
* **Impact:** This ensures "Equal Treatment of Parties" (Section 18). Any clause that allows one party to dominate the appointment process is now void.


* **Shakti Pump India Ltd. v. Apex Buildsys Ltd. (March 2025):**
* **The Rule:** Clarified that participating in an arbitration does not mean you have waived your right to challenge a unilateral appointment.
* **The Decision:** Unless there is an **"express agreement in writing"** (not just conduct) after the dispute has arisen, a unilateral appointment remains illegal under Section 12(5).


* **Aslam Ismail Khan Deshmukh v. ASAP Fluids (2025):**
* **The Rule:** While Section 11 is about "existence" of the agreement, the court must "prima facie" weed out **dead claims** (time-barred) to save parties from costly, futile arbitrations.

## 2. Section 12: Grounds for Challenge & The 7th Schedule

Section 12 (read with the 7th Schedule) lists who **cannot** be an arbitrator (e.g., employees, consultants, or those with a financial interest).

* **Perkins Eastman v. HSCC (Reaffirmed 2026 INSC 6):**
* **The Rule:** A person ineligible to *be* an arbitrator is also ineligible to *appoint* one.
* **Recent Update:** The Supreme Court in early 2026 confirmed that this applies even to **three-member tribunals** where a PSU Chairman tries to appoint the presiding arbitrator unilaterally.


* **The "Express Waiver" Rule (2025 Trends):**
* Courts are now extremely strict about the Proviso to Section 12(5). A "No Objection" recorded in a procedural order by the arbitrator is **not enough**. There must be a signed document by both parties explicitly waiving the conflict of interest.



---

## 3. Section 14 & 15: Termination of Mandate

* **Jagdeep Chowgule v. Sheela Chowgule (Jan 2026):**
* This is the most critical recent case for Section 14. It held that if an arbitrator becomes **"de jure" unable** to perform functions (e.g., they are hit by a Section 12(5) conflict), their mandate terminates automatically.
* The court clarified that you can challenge this "ineligibility" even for the first time during the Section 34 (set-aside) stage if it goes to the root of the appointment.
