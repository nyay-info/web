# Chpater IV

Chapter IV of the Act (Sections 16–17) is the bedrock of **Arbitral Autonomy**. The central theme in 2025 and 2026 has been the "Hands-Off" approach by courts, ensuring that the Arbitrator is the primary judge of their own power.

## 1. Section 16: The "Kompetenz-Kompetenz" Principle

This section empowers the Arbitral Tribunal to rule on its own jurisdiction, including objections regarding the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement.

### **The "Referral First" Rule (2024–2026)**

* **In Re: Interplay between Arbitration Agreements and Stamp Act (2024):**
* **The Ruling:** A 7-judge Constitution Bench held that the issue of **non-stamping** or insufficient stamping of a contract must be decided by the **Arbitral Tribunal under Section 16**, and not by the Court at the Section 11 stage.
* **Impact:** This prevents the "stamping" excuse from being used as a stalling tactic in court.


* **Shivranjan Towers CHS v. Bhujbal Constructions (Bombay HC, Sept 2025):**
* **The Rule:** Confirmed that even if a party claims they are a **non-signatory** or the dispute is "non-arbitrable," these are "mixed questions of fact and law" that should be raised via a Section 16 application before the Arbitrator first.


* **Bakhtawar Ahmad Rather v. AAI (Delhi HC, Aug 2025):**
* **The Rule:** Issues of **"Accord and Satisfaction"** (i.e., whether the dispute was already settled by a final payment) are now strictly for the Arbitrator to decide under Section 16, unless the claim is "dead" or "manifestly time-barred."



### **Timeline and Appeals**

* **Section 16(2):** A jurisdictional plea must be raised **no later than the Statement of Defence**. If you miss this window, you are deemed to have waived your right to object (unless the delay is justified).
* **Section 16(5) & (6):** If the Arbitrator **rejects** your jurisdictional challenge, they don't stop. They continue the case and pass a final award. You can only challenge that rejection later under **Section 34**. You *cannot* file an immediate appeal against a rejection of a Section 16 plea.

## 2. Section 17: Interim Measures by the Tribunal

This section gives the Arbitrator the same powers as a Civil Court to grant "injunctions" or "stays" during the proceedings.

* **Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings v. Future Retail (2021 / Applied 2025):**
* **The Rule:** Interim orders passed by an Arbitrator (including **Emergency Arbitrators**) are enforceable in India just like an order of a Civil Court.


* **Enforcement Mechanism:** If a party violates a Section 17 order, the other party can approach the Court under **Section 27(5)** for contempt or seek enforcement under **Section 17(2)** as if it were a court decree.

## 3. Comparison of Judicial Gatekeeping (2026 Update)

The current legal landscape creates a clear "division of labor" between the Court and the Arbitrator:

| Issue | Who Decides? | Recent Case Law |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Existence of Agreement** | Court (Section 8/11) | *NN Global (2024)* |
| **Validity (Stamping)** | Arbitrator (Section 16) | *Interplay Case (2024)* |
| **Arbitrability of Subject** | Arbitrator (Section 16) | *Shivranjan Towers (2025)* |
| **Limitation (Dead Claims)** | Court (Section 11) | *Bakhtawar Ahmad (2025)* |
| **Fraud/Forgery** | Arbitrator (Section 16) | *Popular Caterers (2025)* |

---

### **Important Procedural Note for 2026**

If the Arbitrator **accepts** a Section 16 plea and drops the case, that order is **immediately appealable** under Section 37. However, if they **reject** it, you are "stuck" in the arbitration until the very end. This is a deliberate "pro-arbitration" design to prevent mid-stream appeals from killing the timeline.
