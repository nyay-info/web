# Nyay.info: AI Usage & Ethics Policy

**Last Updated:** February 2026

**Compliance Version:** MeitY SGI-2025 Standard

#### **1. Purpose & Philosophy**

This blog utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance legal research, summarize complex statutes, and structure analysis. Our guiding principle is **"Innovation over Restraint"**—we leverage technology to make law accessible, but never at the cost of accuracy or professional integrity.

#### **2. Mandatory Disclosures (Rule 3(3) Compliance)**

* **Identification of SGI:** Any content that is algorithmically generated or significantly modified is labeled as **Synthetically Generated Information (SGI)**.
* **Visual Labelling:** All AI-assisted images or infographics on this site feature a permanent label covering at least **10% of the visual area**.
* **Metadata Traceability:** We utilize C2PA-compliant digital watermarking. We do not remove or suppress metadata identifiers that trace the origin of AI content.

#### **3. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Standards**

AI is a tool, not an author. Every post on this blog undergoes a **"Triple-Check"** protocol before publication:

1. **Technical Audit:** Verification of AI reasoning logs for logical consistency.
2. **Legal Verification:** Manual cross-checking of all citations against primary sources (SCC, AIR, etc.).
3. **Ethical Review:** Ensuring the content does not contain algorithmic bias or non-consensual imagery.

#### **4. Professional Liability & Accuracy**

* **No Legal Advice:** Content generated or assisted by AI is for **informational purposes only**. No attorney-client relationship is formed.
* **Hallucination Risk:** While we mitigate "Model Drift" and hallucinations, users are cautioned that AI can periodically generate factually incorrect legal precedents.
* **Attribution:** We acknowledge the use of [Name of Model, e.g., GPT-5/Gemini 2.0] in the production of this content.

#### **5. Data Privacy (DPDP Act 2023 Compliance)**

We do not feed confidential client data, non-public court documents, or sensitive personal identifiers into third-party AI models. All research is conducted using anonymized prompts or local, secure AI instances.

#### **6. Grievance Redressal**

If you believe any AI-generated content on this site is inaccurate, misleading, or violates your rights:

* **Contact:** [Grievance Officer Name/Email]
* **Response Time:** We will acknowledge your grievance within 24 hours and provide a resolution/correction within 15 days as per IT Rules.
